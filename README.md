# Code-Challenge

For this coding challenge you will build a webpage based off of a mockup image.
Follow the steps below to complete the challenge.

1. Fork this repo, to create a new repository of your own, to share with your completed work.

2. You should have an **index.html** file, along with **assets, css, js,** and **mockup** folders.

3. Check the **mockup** folder for the two responsive sizes you'll be creating.

4. Palette colors will be provided in the HTML file.

5. Our project uses the **"Roboto Condensed"** font face weights 100 and 700. _Use whatever method you want to access the font._

6. Have the main content centered and a max width of 563px in mobile view and 960px in desktop.

7. Use font-awesome where required.

8. On each orange button of the cards, a user can click on the button and toggle between showing and hiding the content in each "card". When a user clicks on the button to toggle showing/hiding the content:
  - The icon and text in the button should change to an 'eye' icon and "View [Giving Plan/Charity]"
  - The card content should be hidden and replaced with a header that says "Info Hidden"

9. Once you are finished please open a issue on the `ktownecreative/Code-Challenge` repo letting us know that you've completed your work and we can review on your fork.

**_Bonus Points_** 

1. Use SCSS/SASS for your styling and compile it down to CSS

We encourage the use of Vanilla JavaScript but feel free to use any package/tools you wish but be ready to discuss why you used them and where you used it. (Because we can learn from you, too)

A copy of these instructions can be found in the **index.html** file, as well.

If you have ANY trouble, feel free to open an issue in the `ktownecreative/Code-Challenge` repo and we will be happy to assist.
